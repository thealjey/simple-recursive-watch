    <h3>simple-recursive-watch 1.2.3</h3>










    




    <section>
        <article><h1>simple-recursive-watch</h1><p><em>A simple cross platform recursive directory watcher for NodeJS, based on <strong>fs.watch</strong>, but not relying on its
<strong>recursive</strong> option.</em></p>
<p>I just got tired of <strong>gulp.watch</strong> and <strong>gulp-watch</strong>.
Because they rely on a hopelessly broken <em>gaze</em> library, which besides being too resource intensive for my liking, also
crashes all the time.</p>
<p>Errors happen all the time, we cannot completely prevent them from happening. A good application is the one that handles
those errors gracefully instead of dying all the time, producing a long and unreadable error stack that prevents you
from seeing what really matters.</p>
<p>Fortunately, NodeJS contains a very handy utility called <strong>fs.watch</strong>, which is much more performant and less resource
intensive, because it uses native operating system events to do it's job.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though it cannot be reliably used to spy on a whole tree of folders recursively. Which is what this
library is for.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3><pre class="prettyprint source"><code>npm i simple-recursive-watch --save</code></pre><h3>Example usage</h3><pre class="prettyprint source"><code>import watch from 'simple-recursive-watch';

watch('lib', 'js', function () {
  console.log('something changed');
}, '__tests__', 'ignoreMe.js');</code></pre><h3>Explanation</h3><p>The provided callback is invoked, immediately and only once, when somewhere in the <strong>src</strong> directory a <strong>&quot;.js&quot;</strong> file is
created, edited, renamed, moved around or deleted, excluding those residing in a <strong>&quot;__tests__&quot;</strong> directory or having
a name <strong>&quot;ignoreMe.js&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>You can specify any number of file or directory names to ignore.</p></article>
